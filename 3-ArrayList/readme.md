| Feature                  | Array                                 | ArrayList                              | LinkedList                             | Vector                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure Type**  | Fixed-size collection                 | Resizable array                        | Doubly linked list                     | Resizable array                         |
| **Size**                 | Fixed size (must be defined at creation) | Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed) | Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed) | Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed) |
| **Performance**          | Fast for accessing elements           | Moderate; slower than array due to resizing and copying | Slow for random access, fast for insertion/deletion | Moderate; slower than ArrayList for resizing |
| **Memory Overhead**      | Low (only stores elements)           | Moderate (stores a bit more memory for dynamic array) | High (node overhead for links)        | Moderate (like ArrayList, but synchronized) |
| **Synchronized**         | Not synchronized                      | Not synchronized                       | Not synchronized                       | Synchronized (thread-safe)             |
| **Traversal**            | Can be traversed using loops         | Can be traversed using loops, iterator | Can be traversed using loops, iterator | Can be traversed using loops, iterator  |
| **Insertion/Deletion**   | Costly (requires shifting elements)  | Costly in the middle (requires shifting elements) | Fast for insertion/deletion at ends and in the middle | Costly in the middle (requires resizing) |
| **Element Type**         | Can store primitives and objects      | Can only store objects (autoboxing for primitives) | Can only store objects                  | Can only store objects                  |
| **Use Cases**            | Use when the number of elements is known and fixed | Use when a dynamic list is needed, frequently changing | Use when frequent insertions/deletions are needed | Use when a thread-safe dynamic list is needed |
